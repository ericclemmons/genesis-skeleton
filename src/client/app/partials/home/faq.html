<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

<h4>Why <a href="http://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> <small>instead of a different framework</small>?</h4>

<p>
  For robust applications with a lot of moving parts,
  AngularJS has shown to support both rapid prototypes and complex applications requiring well-structured architecture.
</p>

<p>
  Don't fret, though!

  You're only a simple <code>bower install</code> away from having your favorite framework.

<h4>How is this different from <a href="http://yeoman.io/">Yeoman</a> <small>and other generators</small>?</h4>

<p>
  Yeoman is a fantastic generator project.

  This project is, however, *not* a generator.

  Genesis Skeleton is an opinionated starter application meant for you to fork,
  modify, and start each project with a well-organized and flexible foundation.
